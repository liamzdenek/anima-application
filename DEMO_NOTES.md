## Introduction (1 minute)
- Hi Shun and the team at Anima.
- I'm Liam. I'm a hands-on SWE with 14 YOE with a track record of impact
- Interested in applying for the Principal Engineer Role at Anima
- I made a project to apply to your job instead of sending a traditional application.
- I want to demonstrate both my technical skills and alignment with Anima's mission
- "I built a Blood Test Follow-Up Alert Dashboard because it directly addresses a critical healthcare problem: missed abnormal test results can lead to patient harm - exactly the kind of problem Anima is solving"
- I completed this end-to-end implementation in just a few hours, demonstrating my ability to rapidly ship valuable features that could save lives

## Technical Architecture & Implementation (1.5 minutes)
- Showcase the full-stack implementation that demonstrates versatility across the tech stack:
  * TypeScript data simulation (connects to your JS/TS expertise Anima is looking for)
  * Python ML pipeline
    * Training
    * Reporting
    * Inference
  * React frontend (Vite) with UX focus (shows your "obsessive concern with UX" that Anima values)
- "I focused on shipping a working solution that solves a real problem rather than getting caught in technical perfectionism, which is what I think you are looking for in this role."

## User Experience & Clinical Impact (1 minute)
- Show the user interface from a clinician's perspective:
  * Clean, intuitive design that minimizes cognitive load
  * Clear visualization of abnormal results
- Emphasize the real-world impact: "This system could reduce missed follow-ups by X%, potentially saving numerous lives"
- Connect to Anima's mission: "With this project, I tried to center clinical value and patient outcomes with every design decision, in the same way Anima does"

## Active Learning Loop Demo (1.5 minutes)
- Demonstrate the active learning component that improves the model based on clinician feedback:
  * Show how the system flags potentially abnormal results
  * Demonstrate the feedback mechanism where clinicians can mark predictions as correct/incorrect
  * Explain how this feedback loop continuously improves the model's accuracy
- Connect to Anima's core technology: "This active learning approach mirrors Anima's goal of an Active Learning OS, where systems get better through continuous feedback"
- Highlight how this approach could scale to handle more complex medical data, similar to Anima's vision for deep phenotyping. Attention is all you need, after all.

## Conclusion & Why Anima (1 minute)
- Summarize what makes this project relevant to Anima:
  * End-to-end implementation showing my full-stack capabilities
  * Active Learning approach
  * Focus on solving real healthcare problems that impact lives
  * I work pragmatically, and I can ship quickly
- Express why you're excited about Anima specifically:
  * "I'm drawn to Anima's flat hierarchy and focus on autonomy and ownership"
  * "I want to be part of a team where technical excellence and customer (clinical) impact are equally valued"
  * One of my personal learning goals is to improve my product-oriented thinking, and a place that is relentlessly focusing on patient outcomes is exactly the environment I seek.
- "I believe this project demonstrates that I'm ready to ship important features that will directly increase lives saved in my first two weeks, just as your job description says"
- I look forward to hearing back, thank you for your consideration.
