# Project Brief: Active Patient Follow-Up Alert Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Active Patient Follow-Up Alert Dashboard is a lightweight web application that simulates an automated alert system for abnormal lab results. The dashboard displays a list of patients flagged for follow-up, with risk scores derived from a machine learning model that can be refined through user feedback—implementing an active learning loop.

## Core Requirements

1. **Abnormal Lab Result Detection**
   - Identify patients with abnormal blood test results that require clinical follow-up
   - Prioritize patients based on risk scores
   - Minimize missed abnormal results (false negatives)
   - Provide confidence scores and explanations for predictions

2. **Machine Learning Pipeline**
   - Train models on synthetic blood test data
   - Validate models for clinical safety and fairness
   - Serve predictions via a REST API
   - Support active learning through clinician feedback

3. **User Interface**
   - Allow healthcare providers to enter blood test results
   - Display prediction results with risk scores and contributing factors
   - Enable feedback on prediction accuracy
   - Present information in a clear, clinical interface

4. **System Integration**
   - Simulate integration with EMR systems
   - Provide API endpoints for data exchange
   - Support batch processing of test results

## Project Goals

1. **Improve Patient Safety**
   - Reduce missed abnormal lab results
   - Ensure timely follow-up for high-risk patients
   - Provide decision support for healthcare providers

2. **Demonstrate Technical Capabilities**
   - Full-stack implementation (ML, API, UI)
   - Active learning approach
   - Clinical safety and fairness considerations

3. **Create Extensible Framework**
   - Support for additional test types
   - Scalable architecture for real-world deployment
   - Integration with existing healthcare systems

## Success Criteria

1. **Technical Performance**
   - Model sensitivity ≥ 95% (minimize missed abnormal results)
   - Model specificity ≥ 70% (reasonable false positive rate)
   - API response time < 500ms
   - UI responsive and intuitive

2. **Clinical Utility**
   - Clear presentation of risk scores
   - Transparent explanation of contributing factors
   - Effective prioritization of high-risk patients
   - Useful feedback mechanism

3. **Demonstration Value**
   - Compelling 5-minute demo flow
   - Clear illustration of the active learning concept
   - Demonstration of technical breadth and depth
