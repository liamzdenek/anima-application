## Known Issues

### Data Simulation
1. **Issue**: Limited variety in abnormal patterns
   **Impact**: May not cover all real-world scenarios
   **Plan**: Enhance simulator with more complex abnormality patterns

2. **Issue**: Fixed reference ranges for some tests
   **Impact**: May not accurately reflect clinical variability
   **Plan**: Implement more dynamic reference ranges based on additional factors

### Machine Learning
1. **Issue**: Potential overfitting on synthetic data
   **Impact**: May not generalize to real-world data
   **Plan**: Implement more robust cross-validation and regularization

2. **Issue**: Limited feature engineering
   **Impact**: May miss complex patterns in the data
   **Plan**: Explore more sophisticated feature engineering techniques

### Inference API
1. **Issue**: No authentication mechanism
   **Impact**: Not secure for production use
   **Plan**: Implement OAuth2 authentication

2. **Issue**: Limited error handling for edge cases
   **Impact**: May fail unexpectedly with unusual inputs
   **Plan**: Enhance error handling and add more comprehensive input validation

### User Interface
1. **Issue**: Form becomes unwieldy with many test fields
   **Impact**: Poor user experience for comprehensive test panels
   **Plan**: Implement collapsible sections and better organization

2. **Issue**: Limited mobile responsiveness
   **Impact**: Difficult to use on smaller screens
   **Plan**: Enhance responsive design for all screen sizes
