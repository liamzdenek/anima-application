# Active Context: Active Patient Follow-Up Alert Dashboard

## Current Work Focus

The Active Patient Follow-Up Alert Dashboard project is currently in the implementation phase, with all core components developed and ready for integration. The current focus is on:

1. **End-to-End Integration**: Ensuring all components work together seamlessly
2. **UI Refinement**: Improving the user experience for healthcare providers
3. **Active Learning Implementation**: Completing the feedback loop for model improvement
4. **Validation Reporting**: Enhancing the validation reports for clinical stakeholders

## Recent Changes

### Data Simulation
- Implemented realistic blood test data generation with TypeScript
- Added support for demographic-specific reference ranges
- Created abnormality flagging logic based on reference ranges

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- Implemented training pipeline with multiple model types
- Added comprehensive validation suite with clinical safety metrics
- Created model selection logic based on combined performance metrics
- Implemented temporal validation to ensure model stability

### Inference API
- Developed FastAPI server with prediction endpoints
- Added support for single and batch predictions
- Implemented model loading and versioning
- Created detailed response schema with confidence scores and contributing factors

### User Interface
- Implemented test entry form with reference range inputs
- Created results display with risk scores and contributing factors
- Added demo data loading for testing
- Implemented form validation and error handling

## Active Decisions

### Model Selection Criteria
- **Decision Needed**: Finalize the weighting of different metrics for model selection
- **Options**:
  - Prioritize sensitivity (minimize false negatives)
  - Balance sensitivity and specificity
  - Use F1 score as the primary metric
- **Current Direction**: Leaning toward prioritizing sensitivity with a minimum threshold of 95%

### Threshold Optimization
- **Decision Needed**: Determine the optimal threshold for binary classification
- **Options**:
  - Fixed threshold (e.g., 0.5)
  - ROC curve optimization
  - Clinical cost function optimization
- **Current Direction**: Using a clinical cost function that penalizes false negatives more heavily than false positives

### Feedback Collection Strategy
- **Decision Needed**: Determine how to collect and incorporate user feedback
- **Options**:
  - Simple binary feedback (correct/incorrect)
  - Detailed feedback with reason codes
  - Implicit feedback based on user actions
- **Current Direction**: Starting with simple binary feedback, with plans to expand to more detailed feedback

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1. Complete the active learning feedback loop implementation
2. Enhance the UI with more intuitive visualization of risk scores
3. Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the system
4. Implement automated testing for critical components

### Medium-term (Next 1-2 Months)
1. Add support for additional types of blood tests
2. Implement user authentication and role-based access control
3. Create an administrative dashboard for monitoring system performance
4. Develop a more sophisticated model retraining pipeline

### Long-term (3+ Months)
1. Integrate with real EMR systems through FHIR/HL7 standards
2. Explore more advanced ML models (e.g., deep learning)
3. Implement a full audit trail for clinical decision support
4. Develop mobile applications for on-the-go alerts

## Open Questions

1. **Clinical Validation**: How should we validate the system with real clinical data?
2. **Deployment Strategy**: What is the best approach for deploying in healthcare environments?
3. **Regulatory Considerations**: What regulatory requirements apply to this type of system?
4. **Scaling Strategy**: How should we scale the system to handle large volumes of test results?

## Current Blockers

1. **Validation Data**: Need more diverse synthetic data for comprehensive validation
2. **Performance Testing**: Need to establish performance benchmarks for the complete system
3. **UI/UX Feedback**: Need input from healthcare providers on the user interface
4. **Integration Testing**: Need to test all components together in an end-to-end workflow
